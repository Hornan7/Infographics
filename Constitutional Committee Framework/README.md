## ðŸ“œ Constitutional Committee Framework

**Description**
This infographic is a **step-by-step guide for ada holders who want to come together and form a consortium** in order to represent a single **Constitutional Committee (CC) member voice** on Cardano.

Presented as a series of correspondence letters, it breaks down the use of **Credential Manager tools** in a clear and structured way, showing how cold/hot credentials, certificates, and roles are created, managed, and combined to build a valid consortium CC seat.

Each step is stamped with the role involved, making it easy to follow responsibilities and track the governance flow. While SPOs, DReps, or anyone in the ecosystem can learn from it, this framework is especially designed to **empower ada holders** with a practical, visual roadmap for participating in on-chain governance at the CC level.
