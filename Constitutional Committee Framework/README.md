## üìú Constitutional Committee Framework

This infographic is a **step-by-step guide for ada holders who want to come together and form a consortium** in order to represent a single **Constitutional Committee (CC) member voice** on Cardano.

Presented as a series of correspondence letters, it breaks down the use of **Credential Manager tools** in a clear and structured way, showing how cold/hot credentials, certificates, and roles are created, managed, and combined to build a valid consortium CC seat.

Each step is stamped with the role involved, making it easy to follow responsibilities and track the governance flow. This framework is especially designed to **empower ada holders** with a practical, visual roadmap for participating in on-chain governance at the CC level.
